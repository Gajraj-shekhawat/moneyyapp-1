I have deployed the frontend and backend, I have also used search params so you can directly connect with the backend using params in the URL. as well as I have implemented the sort feature and filter feature. You can simply click on add to cart button to add that item to the cart. i navbar you can see length of cart as well as. If item is already in cart you cannt add again.
